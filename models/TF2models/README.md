# Tensorflow 2.x

These models are generated using Tensorflow 2.16.2, but as it is slower in training, and there are no benefits from using the newer version, these are not used as default.

As these models are much easier to continue training, the implementation for Tensorflow 2.X is fully implemented

In general you find the scripts for training in scripts/training and then in a subfolder kalded keras in each of the different areas.
